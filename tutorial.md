# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will go through the entire process of creating a new character controller, step-by-step. This will cover a wide variety of features, and will give you an overview of all the different ways Rival can be customized.

The tutorial can be followed without downloading the final project, but the completed tutorial project can be downloaded here (Note that **you will need to import Rival** into the project for this to work): [Download](./Downloads/Rival_Tutorial.zip)

Note: Throughout this tutorial, the code samples will often have chunks of excluded code in order to show only the important parts that you need to add or modify. The `// (...)` represents excluded code.

## Bonus: DOTS learning resources

In order to use Rival, you must learn to use DOTS. Here are some resources to help:
* [ECS Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.17/manual/index.html)
* [DOTS Physics Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.physics@0.6/manual/index.html) 
* [ECS Samples repository](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples) on Github. More specifically, the ["Hello Cube"](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EntityComponentSystemSamples/tree/master/ECSSamples/Assets/HelloCube) section which covers the basics of programming with components and systems.
