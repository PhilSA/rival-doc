## Using the Standard Characters & Cameras

The easiest way to get started is with the [Standard Characters](./standard-characters.md) packages included in the Rival package. These packages contain pre-made FirstPerson & ThirdPerson characters and cameras. You can add these to your project as a starting point, and start customizing them to your liking.

The [Tutorial](./tutorial.md) section demonstrates how to use them
