# Samples

Rival comes with a Samples project that can be installed optionally. The samples include a 3D Platformer game, an Online FPS game, a Stress Test scene, and a Basic playground with vehicles and various physics interactions.

In order to get started with the samples, see: [How to install Rival Samples](./Samples/samples-installation.md)

Each sample has its own folder in the project, and its own assembly definition file(s). A "Common" folder holds scripts and assets that are common throughout several samples.
